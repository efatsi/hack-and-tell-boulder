Round 1
=======

The first Boulder Hack and Tell!

Thanks to all who came out to Round 1 (and especially to those who spoke)! We
had four presenters (and incidentally 4 different programming languages).

Also, thanks to Viget for hosting us.


John Dennison
-------------

John showed off some `snazzy graphs and R code
<http://jofusa.github.io/benfords-presentation/index.html#1>`_ that
demonstrated `Benford's Law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law>`_ on
real data. Note to possible future data fakers presenting at Hack and Tell:
John will call you out if you don't have enough 1's in your data.



Patrick Reagan
--------------

Tired of all the language wars between python, ruby, etc? Go back to basics
like Patrick did and write something in C. He's working on a `web server
<https://github.com/vigetlabs/bode>`_.


Ryan Cook
---------

In the most mind warping presentation of the night, Ryan Cook is working on a
submission for `Ruby Trick 2013
<https://sites.google.com/site/trickcontest2013/>`_. He's writing a ruby
program, `sig <https://github.com/cookrn/sig>`_, that takes some ascii art and
another program as input, and then will output the existing code restructured
so the source looks like the ascii art, but it also prints itself out when run.
(Hopefully I got that right).



Jonathan Beluch
---------------

Showed `XBMC Addon Browser <http://xbmcaddonbrowser.com>`_ for exploring `XBMC
<http://xbmc.org>`_ addons. Written with python/flask, source can be found at
https://github.com/jbeluch/xbmc-addon-browser.
